# NOTE: The problem is I need to use a string to identify whether or not a key is ecdsa, ed25519, public or private
#  The PrivateKey class has a 'from_string' class which I can take advantage of easily
#  The PublicKey doesnt have anything helpful, once you have a reference to it you can check if it is ed25519 or ecdsa
#  So I will likely have to add a way to check for the public key, this can be done outside of the PublicKey class,
#   but to keep consistency with the PrivateKey class it would be really nice to have a 'from_string' class in there
#   Ill take a look into it rn to see if it is something I am capable of doing well (I know a way I could but its dookie)
#   It doesnt look like something that I really have any right doing, Im not really sure where to start with the ec key,
#   I'll look into it again
#  Ignoring KeyLists right now
